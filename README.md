# LeetCode Daily Challenge

🎯 **Goal**: Solve at least one LeetCode problem every day and commit the solution to this repository. This is my journey to improve my algorithmic skills and programming ability day by day.

## 📅 Overview

-   **Language**: JavaScript or any other language I'm comfortable with.
-   **Problem Types**: Common algorithm topics on LeetCode like arrays, strings, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, etc.
-   **Objective**: Tackle problems of varying difficulty, from easy to hard, progressively enhancing analytical and problem-solving skills.

## 🗓 Commitment

-   I commit to solving and pushing at least one solution each day. Solutions are organized by date and problem name.

## 🧩 Directory Structure

-   `Problems/[status]/[difficult]`: Contains the solutions to the problems.
-   `README.md`: This document.

## 📈 Progress Tracking

-   Daily progress will be tracked in this repo.
-   The goal is to stay consistent and miss no days!
